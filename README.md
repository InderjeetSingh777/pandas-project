# pandas-project

# Python is a great language for doing data analysis, primarily because of the fantastic ecosystem of data-centric Python packages. Pandas is one of those packages, and makes importing and analyzing data much easier. Pandas builds on packages like NumPy and matplotlib to give you a single, convenient, place to do most of your data analysis and visualization work.

# This project uses  Pandas to analyze data on video game reviews from IGN, a popular video game review site. The data was scraped by Eric Grinstein, and can be found here. As we analyze the video game reviews, we'll learn key Pandas concepts like indexing.
